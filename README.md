# Encryption Assigment

* This assignment was completed for CS 5352: Computer Security course Spring 2019 under Dr. Deepak Tosh

## Part 3

* For the first part of this assigment I was tasked to complete the source code so that the image tux.ppm would be encrypted using ECB mode, and CBC mode. As can be seen in the assigment report, Assginemtn1 DLR file, the picture encrypted with ECB is easily decipherable. 

## Part B

* I provided an analysis of how a potential attacker can tell if the IVs used for CBC encryption have been changed.

## Part C

* I proved a small explanation of OFB (Output Feedback mode), and how a potential plaintext can still be deciphered even if a small part of it (a block) is lost.

## Part 4

* A small example of RSA technique, and possible keys for decryption and encryption with a set of given values.

## Part 5

* Using a python source code, I created a script that takes in three parameters, a path to a public key file, a path to a ciphertext file, and a path to a file enumerating possible messages. When the scrip is executed, the identified message should be printed. 

* For the second section of this part, I was tasked to use padding when encrypting the message.
